# SmarterMail ActiveSync

 ActiveSync is available for use with smartphones, tablets, and Outlook 2013 for Windows. It is a popular method of syncing because it allows users to sync emails, contacts, calendars, and tasks (depending on the device) using only one protocol. It also syncs using push technology so all of your information is delivered in real time. ActiveSync is an annual paid add-on which requires active upgrade protection. It is available as an optional add-on to your mailbox for $1 per month.

### Enable ActiveSync
1. [Log in](https://my.gearhost.com) to your account
2. Click the CloudSite you have the mailbox enabled on
3. Click the Email tab
4. Click the domain that has the mailbox enabled on
5. Update the status to **Enabled** for your mailbox
