### What Does This Mean
Each CloudSite is **billed per hour**, up to its monthly cap. The monthly cost of your CloudSite is calculated by running the **hourly rate for 28 days** (672 hours). **Once you reach that amount** (e.g. $5/mo for a Standard CloudSite), you **will not be charged** for the CloudSite **additional runtime**.

>This allows you to **destroy your CloudSite** before the maximum monthly charge and **pay only for what you use**.

> The hours start when the cloud site is created. Stopping the cloud site does not stop the hourly billing. Stop the billing by scaling down to the free plan or deleting the site.

### Limitations without Signing up with Credit Card
With no credit card you are only able to **create up to 5 free CloudSites** and **5 free databases**. 

Once you verify your account **by adding a credit card** on file you are then able to **add up to 10 free CloudSites** and **10 free databases**.
