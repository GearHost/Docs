### What Does This Mean
Each CloudSite is **billed per hour**, up to its monthly cap. The monthly cost of your CloudSite is calculated by running the **hourly rate for 28 days** (672 hours). **Once you reach that amount** (e.g. $5/mo for a Standard CloudSite), you **will not be charged** for the CloudSite **additional runtime**.

>This allows you to **destroy your CloudSite** before the maximum monthly charge and **pay only for what you use**.
