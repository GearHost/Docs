# What is .NET Core?
.NET Core is esentially a fork of the .NET Framework. It's been redesigned to offer better performance and many other features!

#### What's the benefit of using .NET Core compared to ASP.NET?
One of the main benefits is that it's cross platform. You can run your application on Windows, Linux, or MacOS.
It offers a robust Microservice Architecture, is designed for scaleable systems and high performance applications. Simply put, you can mix microservices or services developed with .NET Framework, Java, Ruby, or other monolithic technologies and immediately increase your resources.
