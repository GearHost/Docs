# GearHost Backups

### How often are backups performed?
GearHost automatically backs up data for a retention period of 5 days. Each run overwrites any previous backups and most backups run between 12AM-4AM. 

### Are restores free?
Our backups are only done as courtesy, but we do recommend manually backing up your own data. If you wish to use our backups to restore anything our fee is $30.00. Any additional or subsequent restorations will also incur a fee. 

### How do I request a restore?
To request a restore please contact our support team by opening a [support ticket.](https://www.gearhost.com/documentation/how-to-open-a-support-ticket) When submitting a support ticket, please be sure to state what you want restored and authorizing the $30.00 restore fee. If you need data restored and do not want us to overwrite anything please let us know.
