### Getting Started With APIs

- [Log in to your GearHost Account](https://my.gearhost.com/account/login)
- Select the **API** menu on the top left
- Click **Create API Key**

You will be provided a **long API Key**, which would be what our blue bar covers.

**Make sure this key remains private!** APIs are triggered by POST and GET requests. This would be an example using cURL requests. You can review more API documentation under [api.gearhost.com](http://docs.gearhost.apiary.io/#)

Get account information.

Every CloudSite has an **ID**. The green bar is where it provides that **ID**.

Some API functions require both your **API Key** and **CloudSite ID**. In this example, we're starting the application pool.
