# My site was compromised
There can be several factors as to why your website may have been compromised. Here we provide the most important things you need to be aware of. 


**How was my site compromised?**

1. A leading cause for a compromised site is a weak admin password. It's the norm for hackers to brute force `admin` usernames with the most common passwords. We recommend changing your `admin` username to something else and ensuring that your password isn't `password`. We recommend using a mix of letters, numbers, symbols, and that's at least 8-12 characters long.


2. Another inconvenience can be third party content such as plugins, themes, and other cms add-ons which can lead to vulnerabilities. Make sure to download content from a reputable source and to always keep the software up to date!

3. Lastly, an attacker may have compromised your local machine. We recommend running a virus/malware scan on any machine you use to access your site. Always be cautious of opening suspicious e-mail attachments or visiting links that you're not familiar with.    
  
**How do I fix my site?**

The best thing to do would be to consult a developer depending on which sort of application you're using. If it's a custom app it will likely require a code audit or re-uploading a snapshot of the files.
