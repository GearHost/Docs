This article explains how to manage your SmarterMail mailbox email accounts such as adding a new mailbox, changing the password of an existing mailbox or modifying anything else regarding a mailbox. You must first have [email enabled on your domain](https://www.gearhost.com/documentation/enable-email).

### Login to your SmarterMail
